    c(person(given = "Randy",
             family = "Lai",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "randy.cs.lai@gmail.com"),

Description: Provides high performance container data types such as Queue,
    Stack, Deque, Dict and OrderedDict. Benchmarks
    <https://randy3k.github.io/collections/articles/benchmark.html> have
    shown that these containers are asymptotically more efficient than
    those offered by other packages.
