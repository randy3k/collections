Description: Provides high performance container data types such
    as Queue, Stack, deque, dict and Ordereddict. Benchmarks
    <https://randy3k.github.io/collections/articles/benchmark.html> have
    shown that these containers are asymptotically more efficient than
    those offered by other packages.
